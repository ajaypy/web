for a given string S, a query word is 'stretchy' if it can be made to be 
equal to S, by any number of applications of the extension operations

choose a group of characters c and add some characters so that the size of the group is 3 or more


S = "heeellooo"
stretchy = "hello"


find the distinct characters and their counts in S
store in hashmap or list of list/tuple 
traverse the stretchy and see if it can be turned into S

cannot be a hashmap as the characters may repeat

so traverse the stretchy, 
make sure it has characters in same order as S and the count is 
euqal
or 
less than in S, as the case may be
