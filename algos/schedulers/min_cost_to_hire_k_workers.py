There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.

For each worker find its Pay/Quality rato
Using this ratio find the total pay for all the workers

Repeat for all the remaining workers

Choose the minimum

There will be at least one worker with the minimum wage
So find one such worker which will be paid the minimum wage

Once the ratio R is known then other workers can be selected

As the pay is in ratio of quality , hiring minimum quality workers 
can help
