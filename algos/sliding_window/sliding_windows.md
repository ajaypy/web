Sliding window based problems are a subset of dynamic programming problems.

* the problem will involve a data structure that is ordered and iterable like a string or an array

* need to find some subrange in that iterable, like longest,shortest or target value

* there is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in "O( N square)

* looking for optimal, longest or shortest


The search for an optimum hints at the relationship between sliding window and dynamic problems.
Optimal substructure property of the problem to guarantee that an optimal solution to a subproblem can be reused to help find the optimal solution to a larger problem.
